Setting up the Arduino IDE to work with the ATTiny45

Source: http://42bots.com/tutorials/how-to-program-attiny85-with-arduino-uno-part-1/

1. Download the ATTiny library from https://github.com/damellis/attiny/archive/master.zip

2. Unzip the attiny master.zip file. It should contain an "attiny-master" folder that contains an "attiny" folder.

3. Create a new sub-folder called "hardware" in the sketchbook folder, if it doesn't exist already.

4. Copy the "attiny" folder (not the attiny-master folder) from the unzipped ATtiny master.zip to the "hardware" folder.

5. In the Arduino IDE, select ATtiny45 (internal 8 MHz clock) as the board.

Now, setup the Arduino Uno as an ArduinoISP programmer, by selecting ArduinoISP under the Programmer tab. Then click (Burn Bootloader to program the fuse settings). Then, click File->Upload using Programmer to program the ATTiny.
